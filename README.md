# Feels Like Weather
A simple page showing the current ambient weather using [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev).

This project is based on the [freeCodeCamp local weather project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/show-the-local-weather/).

## Notice
As it is best practice to obfuscate API keys, this project will not work client-side without my API key. Current thoughts are to either implement CodePen's solution of prompting the user for an API key or to refactor the project to use the [freeCodeCamp Weather API](https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/).

## To Do
- [x] Set up geolocation
- [x] Set up API call
- [x] Format display data from API response
- [x] Add temperature unit toggle
- [ ] If no geolocation, prompt for location
- [ ] Geocode location for weather API call
- [ ] Format location error display
- [ ] Prettify
- [ ] Refactor to work on GitHub pages
